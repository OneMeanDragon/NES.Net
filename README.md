Still not working, you can view the patterns currently being used by pressing "p" while emulating.
The Palettes are showen under the 2 Pattern tables.

my testing has been mostly with Arkanoid, though I have also tested with smb1-2-3 (all of which do work with the olc). The palletes do draw, however the actual game screen will not draw properly, pretty sure its where the olc diverted to a signed integer within the scanline sections, but ive lost interest after the amount of hours it took just to get it this far to pin point anything further than that.
